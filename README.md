# cfn-foldingathome
> CloudFormation template for Folding@home on AWS spot instances.

![Lint CloudFormation Templates](https://github.com/jkataja/cfn-foldingathome/workflows/Lint%20CloudFormation%20Templates/badge.svg)

This template creates an AWS spot instance fleet for running the [Folding@Home](https://foldingathome.org/) client.
Folding@home is a computing platform to assist disease research, for instance to find a cure for the COVID-19 virus.
The template uses G4-type instances with NVIDIA TESLA GPUs.
Please only deploy it on accounts where you have the permissions to do so.

The template installs the following software:

 - Ubuntu 18.04 LTS
 - NVidia CUDA 10.2
 - Folding@home client 7.6.9

Folding@home client is started automatically after instance initialization is complete.
Client runs until the template is removed, auto scaling group is scaled in or spot instance is reclaimed.
The template bids 100% of on-demand price and instances are unlikely to be reclaimed.
Spot instance pricing varies: expect approximately 60-70% discount for G4 instance type.

WIP Please check whether the solution works for you.

## Usage

### Launch from AWS Console

Create stack using the template S3 URL: `https://cfn-foldingathome.s3.amazonaws.com/foldingathome.yml`

| Parameter              | Description                                                                                                 |
|------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `Anonymous`            | Folding@home fold anonymously (default true for anonymous)                                                  |
| `FoldingAtHomePasskey` | Folding@home pass key (leave empty for anonymous user)                                                      |
| `FoldingAtHomeTeam`    | Folding@home team number (default 0 for no team)                                                            |
| `FoldingAtHomeUser`    | Folding@home user name (default Anonymous for anonymous)                                                    |
| `InstanceCount`        | Scale-out count of `g4dn.xlarge` instances to run the Folding@home client                                   |
| `KeyName`              | SSH [key name](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-key-pairs.html) for `ubuntu` user    |
| `SSHLocation`          | Network allowed to SSH to instances in public subnet (default 0.0.0.0/0 to allow from everywhere)           |
| `Subnets`              | Subnets in VPC (for example the default VPC subnets `172.31.0.0/20`, `172.31.16.0/20` and `172.31.32.0/20`) |
| `VpcId`                | VPC for the stack (for example the default VPC `172.31.0.0/16`)                                             |

Cost of spot instances may vary by availability zone. Auto scaling group may launch instances in higher cost AZs.

### Launch from CLI

To launch one instance with anonymous folding, replace the `KeyName`, `Subnets` and `VpcId` values with your SSH key name and default VPC network parameters:

```sh
aws cloudformation create-stack \
  --stack-name FoldingAtHome \
  --template-url https://cfn-foldingathome.s3.amazonaws.com/foldingathome.yml \
  --parameters \
    ParameterKey="KeyName",ParameterValue="mykeyname" \
    ParameterKey="Subnets",ParameterValue="subnet-12345678\,subnet-56781234" \
    ParameterKey="VpcId",ParameterValue="vpc-abcdefgh" \
--capabilities CAPABILITY_IAM
```

### Access Web UI

Forward port 7396 from the instance to localhost (replace `public-ip` with public IP address of the instance):

```sh
ssh ubuntu@public-ip -L 7396:localhost:7396
```

Now access the Web UI from: http://localhost:7396/

### Installation paths

Folding@home configuration is output to`/etc/fahclient/config.xml` .
Folding progress log output is written to `/var/lib/fahclient/log.txt`.
Show status of the service with `systemctl status fahclient` .
